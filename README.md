## Tutorials for TensorFlow Beginners

this is an introduction to Tensorflow and TensorBoard.

skip this section if you are a experienced user.

#### Simple Softmax Model: 80%+ Accuracy

The dataset is similar to MNIST, The model is also similar to it.

1. Using only 1 softmax layer.
2. Accuracy: 80%+.
3. Training data: 20000 images.
4. Time cost: <3min. using GTX-1080.

```bash
# generating test data
$ python datasets/gen_captcha.py -d --npi 1 -n 2000
# run the model
$ python simple_softmax.py images/char-1-epoch-2000/
```

Output While Training:

```bash
$ time python simple_softmax.py images/char-1-epoch-2000/
data loaded
train images: 20000. test images: 4000
label_size: 10, image_size: 6000
...
step = 9100, accuracy = 91.10%
step = 9200, accuracy = 91.40%
step = 9300, accuracy = 92.00%
step = 9400, accuracy = 91.40%
step = 9500, accuracy = 91.35%
step = 9600, accuracy = 90.80%
step = 9700, accuracy = 91.60%
step = 9800, accuracy = 91.65%
step = 9900, accuracy = 90.50%
testing accuracy = 91.05%

#### TensorBoard

Tensorboard is a suite of visualization tools.

Tensorboard can visualize TensorFlow graph, plot quantitative metrics about the execution of your graph, and show additional data like images that pass through it.

It is really cool and helpful.

some examples:

![](img-doc/m1-softmax-loss.png)
![](img-doc/m1-image-preview.png)
![](img-doc/m1-histograms.png)

**How doest it work?**

1. TensorFlow will write necessary info, defined by `tf.summary`, to log files.
2. TensorBoard will parse the logs and visualize the data.

Adding `tf.summary` to `simple_softmax.py`, we got `softmax_with_log.py`.

Run the model using the same training dataset

```bash
$ python softmax_with_log.py images/char-1-epoch-2000/
```

Launching TensorBoard in a new terminal

```bash
$ Tensorboard --logdir=log
```
